This is a custom stylesheet theme for Chrome DevTools which was forked from https://github.com/frontdevDE/mnml-devtools-theme/.

There were some styles which needed fixing in a couple areas so everything would be readable and better matched with the color scheme as well. It's not perfect, but it's one of the better DevTools themes I've seen.
